    "## OpenAI API Simple Prompt Engineering Examples Using ChatGPT\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome! This notebook is meant to show some simple prompt engineering examples for those just getting started in the field. We will look at four common tasks associated with typical prompt engineering job requirements to get you on the road to becoming an effective developer:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Content Generation\n",
    "- Content Summariziation\n",
    "- Language Translation\n",
    "- Content Automation\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a couple of things to consider as we explore these concepts:\n",
    "First, we are limiting ourselves to exclusively using OpenAI's API even though there might be better alternatives out there to keep things easy to impelement. \n",
    "Second, You will need an OpenAI API key to do these lessons. They give you a $5 credit when you sign up but IT CAN COST MONEY if you aren't careful. \n",
    "Just be aware of your usage patterns and you will be fine. You can sign up for your API access here: https://platform.openai.com/ \n",

    "Assume we work for a book company and they are looking at expanding into the children book market. They don't want to invest a lot of money in authors before they have tested the waters a bit. That's where we come in; our first task is to write a prompt to create a kids short story. The customer wants us to generate a story and make sure the AI outputs an HTML table with the names of the characters from the story and their role in the story so they can put it up on their website.

      "\n",
      "One day, while out exploring, Lina stumbled upon an old hut deep in the forest. The hut looked abandoned but when Lina peered through one of its windows she saw something that made her heart beat faster: inside was the most beautiful creature she had ever seen! It had brilliant emerald eyes and shimmering golden fur. \n",
      "\n",
      "Lina knew at once that this must be some kind of magical beast, so she bravely opened the door and stepped inside. As soon as she did, the creature spoke to her in a gentle voice: \"Welcome child,\" it said, \"I am a phoenix, sent by your grandparents from their realm beyond the stars.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "The phoenix explained that it was here to help her on a journey to find courage and strength within herself - something that would help her throughout life. A little scared but very excited, Lina agreed to take on this quest and began to prepare for her adventure. \n",
      "\n",
      "She gathered supplies from around town and said goodbye to all her friends. Finally, with the phoenix leading the way they set off into unknown lands full of danger and mystery. Along their journey they encountered strange creatures and mysterious places. They faced many challenges but with each one they grew stronger together until eventually they reached their destination: a secret temple hidden high atop an ancient mountain peak. \n",
      "\n",
      "Inside this temple was an enchanted fountain where Lina could finally gain true courage and strength from within herself - something that would stay with her no matter what happened in life. After taking some time to reflect on all that she had experienced during her journey, Lina thanked the phoenix for its guidance before returning home with newfound confidence in herself and hope for what lay ahead.. \n",
